        <p class="work-paragraph-1">
          Believe it or not, copywriting is one of the most important
          content-creation skills a designer can possess. If you think about it,
          design exists to support and deliver content—not the other way around.
          As a designer, content should be the driving force behind many of your
          decisions, whether you’re creating the content or someone else is. So
          if you can understand how to write effective copy (and understand the
          purpose that it serves), you’ll be able to better serve your clients
          and ultimately create better designs.
        </p>
        <p class="work-paragraph-2">
          Sales copywriting is all about getting users to make a purchase or
          sign up for a product or service. UX copywriting, on the other hand,
          is all about helping users reach a goal efficiently and effectively.
          There are overlaps between the two, for sure. But while sales
          copywriting is often about convincing a customer to do something, UX
          copywriting is about helping them do something they’re already trying
          to do. You don’t have to sell them on the goal, just help them achieve
          it.
